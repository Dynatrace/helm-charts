      Bug fixes
        * Don't look at the cluster version when deploying the OneAgent using immutable images. Under certain conditions this may stop the Operator from deploying the OneAgent at all
        * Upgrade OneAgent Pods using the immutable image by looking at the version label embedded on the images

      Other changes
        * Upgrade to Operator SDK 1.3
          * Use ConfigMaps for leases
        * Fix version and deployment instructions for dev builds
