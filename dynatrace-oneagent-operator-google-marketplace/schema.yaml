      v0.7.0

      Breaking changes
      This version drops support for Kubernetes 1.11, 1.12, and 1.13 (#219, #220)

      Features
      Separated the logic for watching the nodes into nodes_controller to handle scaling correctly (#189, #196)
      Show operator phase in the status.phase field of the OneAgent object (#197)
      Build ARM64 images for the Operator (#201, #211)
      No longer change the OneAgent .spec section to set defaults (#206)
      Added a setting to configure a proxy via the CR (#207)
      Added a setting to add custom CA certificates via the CR - These changes are only done for the Operator image as of now and the changes in the OneAgent image are in progress (#208)
      Added proper error handling for Dynatrace API quota limit (#216)

      Bug fixes
      Handle sporadic (and benign) race conditions where the error below would appear (#194),
      Operation cannot be fulfilled on oneagents.dynatrace.com \"oneagent\": the object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again
      Proxy environment variables (e.g., http_proxy, etc.) can be ignored on Operator container when skipCertCheck is true (#204)
      Istio objects don't have an owner object, so wouldn't get removed if the OneAgent object is deleted (#217)

      Other changes
      As part of the support for ARM (#201, #203)
      Migrate CI/CD workflow from CircleCI to TravisCI
      Development snapshot images are now being published to Docker Hub
      Support deprecation of beta.kubernetes.io/arch and beta.kubernetes.io/os labels (#199)
      Update to Operator SDK 0.15.1 (#200)
      Initial work to ease release automation (#198)
      Added automatic creation of CSV file for OLM (#210)
      Now Marked for Termination events will be sent only for deleted Nodes (#213, #214, #223)
      Use v1 instead of v1beta1 for rbac.authorization.k8s.io objects (#215)
      Add OLM manifests for v0.7.0 release (#226)
